# E-portfolio TKInter

This Repo is part of my e-portfolio in Software-Engineering. 
I will present the UI-Tool TKInter for python.

To take part in the practical part of my presentation you need:

- python ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- the packages:
  * pillow
  * TKInter
* editor or IDE (I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows))
